## Environment
Use the requirements.txt in the repository to set up a conda environment with the required packages. Alternatively, create a python environment using the pip version of the requirements.

## Data
1. Download the SemArt dataset from [here](https://noagarcia.github.io/SemArt/) and place the images in the Data/Images folder.
2. Download the Grad-CAM outputs from [here](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1s6-zz9EpUuLfpuNNaFPsmupBElN1suYr?usp=sharing) and place in the Data/Grad-CAMs Author folder.

## Models
Download each model below, extract it, and place it in the Data/Model folder. Make sure you download the folder, not just the individual file, for each model (e.g. best-kgm-author-model.pth/best-kgm-author-model.pth)
